Yggdrasil is a small content mod adding Viking and Norse Mythology related items and enemies.
It also adds a new class, The Runemaster and a new mechanic, Rune Power.
This mod wants to be an addition to vanilla terraria respecting the normal progression of this game we all like.

NOTE: 
- The content of this alpha version of the mod follow the progression of the game until hardmode except for runes.
- Runes are probably unbalanced in many ways but go all the way to moonlord
- If you want to help, feel free to reach out!
- This is an early alpha version of the mod!
