Yggdrasil is a small content mod adding Viking and Norse Mythology related items and enemies.
This mod wants to be an addition to vanilla terraria respecting the normal progression of this game we all like.

At a glance:
- Around 150 new items
- 15+ enemies
- 1 miniboss
- 1 town NPC
- 10+ tiles/furnitures
- 1 new event, The Viking Invasion
- 1 new class, The Runemaster
- 1 new biome, Svartalvheim
- Some structure generations (in the snow biome)

NOTE:
- If you want to help, feel free to reach out! (Good spriters would be nice to have)
- This is an alpha version of the mod! (meaning that there are bugs)
