Yggdrasil is a small content mod adding Viking and Norse Mythology related items and enemies.
This mod wants to be an addition to vanilla terraria respecting the normal progression of this game we all like.

At a glance:
- Around 150 new items
- 15+ enemies
- 1 miniboss
- 1 town NPC
- 10+ tiles/furnitures
- 1 new event The Viking Invasion
- 1 new class The Runemaster

NOTE: 
- Runemaster class content progression is still in development but goes all the way to moonlord.
- Runes are probably unbalanced in many ways and will need fine tunning.
- If you want to help, feel free to reach out!
- This is an alpha version of the mod!
