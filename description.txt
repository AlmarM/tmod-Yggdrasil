Yggdrasil is a small content mod adding Viking and Norse Mythology related items and enemies.
This mod wants to be an addition to vanilla terraria respecting the normal progression of this game we all like.

At a glance:
- 250+ new items and furniture
- 20+ enemies
- 1 miniboss
- 1 town NPC
- 1 new event, The Viking Invasion
- 1 new class, The Runemaster
- 1 new biome, Svartalvheim
- Some structure generations (in the snow biome)

NOTE:
- If you want to help, feel free to reach out! (Good spriters would be nice to have)
- This is an alpha version of the mod! (meaning that there are bugs)

Lyker & resP

0.3.1 - Lots of code refactor and a few tweaks
New Content
- New Moldy Cheese Soup (someone asked for more moldy stuff so, why not?)
- New Toy Wooden Sword (it's good if you don't want to spam click at the start of the game)

Fixes and Tweaks
- Tons of code refactor that is absolutely invisible for you (backend work is what it is)
- Icy Merman and Ice Mimic will drop more glacier shards more often
- Zombiking should spawn less often
- Angry bones will drop more occult shards more often
- Frostcore now shows up with spelunker potion

0.3 - A new biome
New Content
- New biome! Svartalvheim. If you are lucky enough, a minecart track might lead you there. If not, you'll need a lot of mining power to get in. I would not venture there anyway...
- New Svartalvheim enemies. Let there be Dwarves!
- New unique gear found in the biome
- New Nordic gears and armor made out of cold iron
- New Glacier Spear
- New food Moldy Cheese (yep...)
- New Nordic wood furnitures

Fixes and Tweaks
- Cold Iron is now generated in the Svartalvheim biome upon world creation
- Added a bit more loot generated in Viking chests upon world creation
- Frostcore Arrow now only applies frostburn
- Dwarven Medallion now gives def when underground
- Fixed Volva town NPC animations
- Changed the spirtes of nordic wood
- Stuff I probably forget
